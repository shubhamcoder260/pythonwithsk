Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.

Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

Use nested loops to create the following:

Print the following pattern:

0 x 0 = 0
1 x 1 = 1
2 x 2 = 4
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 4 = 16
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 6 = 36
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 8 = 64
9 x 9 = 81
10 x 10 = 100
Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.

Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers

Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers

Exercises: Level 2
Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.
The sum of all numbers is 5050.
Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
